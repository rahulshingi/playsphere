# PlaySphere — Product Requirements (Living Doc)

## Problem Statement
Create a web platform for employee engagement company **PlaySphere** — tagline *"Where Teams Compete, Connect & Grow"*. Build the website with: Team registration, Fixture generation, Live scoring, Standings, Player profiles, Sponsor branding.

## User Choices (gathered)
- Multi-sport + mixed events (sports + non-sports like quizzes, hackathons)
- Auth: JWT-based custom auth (Admin + Viewer) — default
- Fixture types: both round-robin & knockout
- Live scoring: sport-specific
- Sponsors: static banner + tiered (Title / Gold / Silver / Bronze) page

## Architecture
- Backend: FastAPI + MongoDB (Motor), JWT (httpOnly cookie), bcrypt
- Frontend: React + React Router + Shadcn UI + Tailwind + Sonner toasts
- Theme: "Performance Pro" dark theme — Bebas Neue (display), Manrope (body), JetBrains Mono (stats)
- Colors: #0A0A0A bg / #007AFF primary / #FF3B30 destructive/live

## User Personas
1. **Admin** — manages events, teams, sponsors; updates live scores.
2. **Team captain / viewer** — registers teams, follows fixtures & standings.
3. **Spectator** — browses events, players, sponsors anonymously.

## Implemented (Feb 12, 2026)
- JWT auth (login/register/me/logout) with auto-seeded admin & viewer
- Events CRUD + sport/format/status; 3 demo events seeded
- Teams CRUD (public registration); 4 demo teams w/ colors & departments
- Players CRUD; 16 demo players with avatars
- Fixture generation: round-robin (rotation algorithm) & knockout (with winner propagation)
- Sport-specific live scorer (cricket overs/wickets, football goals, badminton sets, basketball points/Q, chess/quiz points, hackathon score)
- Standings table with W/D/L/Pts (3 pts win, 1 pt draw)
- Sponsors with tier hierarchy + static banner across pages
- Admin dashboard with stats + CRUD for events/teams/sponsors
- Landing page with hero, live zone, features bento, upcoming events
- Routes: /, /events, /events/:id, /teams, /teams/:id, /players/:id, /standings, /sponsors, /admin, /login, /register, /register-team

## Implemented (Feb 14, 2026 — Iteration 6)
- **Image upload (`POST /api/upload`, GET `/api/uploads/<name>`)** — works across Vendor Listings, Player Profile photo, and Platform Admin Service image. Auth via cookie, 5MB cap, JPEG/PNG/WEBP/GIF allowed.
  - Fix: route + StaticFiles mount were defined AFTER `app.include_router(api)` (silent 404). Moved BEFORE the include_router call. Regression-guarded by `/app/backend/tests/test_upload.py` (8 tests).

## Implemented (Feb 15, 2026 — Iteration 8) Ground booking wizard + state machine
- **HR booking wizard** at `/hire`: Sport → City → Listings → Date+Start+Hours modal with live total. Drops the old vendor-type tabs as the primary nav.
- **`GET /api/vendor-listings/cities`** — distinct cities for a sport+vendor_type (powers the location chips).
- **`VendorBooking` model extended** — `hours`, `total`, `sport`, `city`, `admin_notes`, `notifications[]`, `hr_email`. POST accepts either `hours` OR `end_time` (server derives the other); explicit 400 if neither.
- **State machine** (vendor + admin both act):
  - HR creates → `pending`
  - Vendor PATCH 'confirmed'/'declined' → remapped to `vendor_accepted`/`vendor_declined`. **Terminal states (confirmed/rejected/cancelled) are 409 for vendor** (audit guard).
  - Admin PATCH → can set `vendor_accepted` | `vendor_declined` | `confirmed` | `rejected` | `cancelled` + `admin_notes`. Override of vendor decision supported.
  - HR PATCH → only `cancelled`, allowed at any non-terminal state.
  - Every status change appends `notifications[]` entry + writes `BOOKING NOTIFICATION for <hr_email> | …` to backend log (mocked email).
- **`VendorBookings` panel** rendered inside `/bookings` — role-aware actions: vendor accept/decline, admin confirm/reject with note, HR cancel. Latest notification surfaces as an inline banner. Vendor nav now has a `Requests` link.
- **20 new pytest tests** in `test_vendor_bookings.py` + state-machine updates to legacy test. Total: 145/145 pass.

## Implemented (Feb 14, 2026 — Iteration 7) Phase 1: CricHeroes-style event setup chain
- **Platform admin event creation:** New "Events" tab in `/platform-admin` with the same form HR uses — sport/format/event_type/venue/banner (upload)/stream URL. "Open" routes to the event detail page where the Teams tab handles team/captain/member management.
- **Public nav:** Teams link removed; Teams now a tab inside `/events/:id`, gated to platform_admin / company_admin / captains.
- **Event model extended:** `event_type` (single_company / inter_company / playsphere_organized), `stream_url`, `companies[]`.
- **Inter-company events:** Platform admin can pick existing companies OR create a new company on the fly — auto-creates HR `company_admin` user with a temp password (returned in API + shown in a credentials modal to the inviter).
- **Team setup chain:** Admin/HR create teams scoped to the event → assign captain (links to a registered PlayerProfile) → add members via "pick registered" OR "quick add" (creates PlayerProfile + temp password shown in modal).
- **Captain permissions:** A player whose PlayerProfile.id matches `team.captain_player_id` can manage that team's members.
- **Live streaming URL** on every event — `PATCH /api/events/{id}/stream`. "WATCH LIVE" CTA + admin inline editor.
- **Forgot / reset password (players):** `POST /api/players/forgot-password` generates a token, logs reset URL to backend log (email integration pending user's provider choice). `POST /api/players/reset-password` validates and rotates the password. New UI: `/players/forgot-password` + `/players/reset-password?token=…`.
- 22 new pytest tests (event teams + password reset), 123/123 total backend tests pass.

## Phase 2 — CricHeroes match flow (next iteration)
- Toss (winner, elected to bat / bowl)
- Playing XI selection per team per match
- Per-innings batting card (R, B, 4s, 6s, SR) + bowling card (O, R, W, Eco)
- Wire LiveScorer to lineup so each run/wicket attributes to a specific player

## Backlog
### P0
- (none open) — MVP complete & tested (31/31 backend, all critical UI flows pass)

### P1
- WebSocket-based real-time score push (currently fetch-on-demand)
- Per-player stats (goals, MoM, etc.) aggregated from match events
- Match-level player participation & substitutions
- Tighten CORS to explicit origins; brute-force lockout on /auth/login

### P2
- Email/Slack notifications for fixture & result updates
- Photo gallery & match highlights upload (object storage)
- Achievements/badges, season MVP, social shareable cards
- Payments for paid tournaments (Stripe) or sponsor billing
